rime Map Insights

We used the Folium Python library to visualize all 2023 crime incidents on an interactive map. Two key maps were produced:

Heatmap: Highlights clusters of high-density crime areas, especially near the city center and certain residential zones.
Cluster Map: Allows users to explore individual crime points by zooming in on neighborhoods.

These spatial patterns may help target law enforcement presence or community safety initiatives.
